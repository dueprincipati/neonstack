NeonStack is a comprehensive, modern web application starter kit designed to help developers quickly bootstrap scalable and maintainable projects. Built with some of the most powerful and developer-friendly technologies available, NeonStack provides a solid foundation for building everything from small side projects to large-scale applications.

## Features

- **Next.js**: React framework for building fast and scalable web applications
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript
- **Postgres on Neon**: Scalable, serverless Postgres database solution
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication for Next.js applications
- **tRPC**: End-to-end typesafe APIs
- **Zod**: TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library**: Testing frameworks for robust applications
- **ESLint** and **Prettier**: Code quality and formatting tools

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Git

## Getting Started

To get started with NeonStack, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dueprincipati/neonstack.git
   cd neonstack
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Edit `.env.local` and add your Neon database URL and other necessary credentials.

4. Set up the database:
   ```
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Key Technologies

### Next.js

Next.js is the core of our application, providing server-side rendering, API routes, and an excellent developer experience. Learn more in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

### TypeScript

We use TypeScript to add static typing to our JavaScript, catching errors early and improving code quality. Check out the [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) for more information.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development with utility classes. Customize your design in `tailwind.config.js`. See the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more.

### Prisma

Prisma is our ORM of choice, providing type-safe database access and easy migrations. Define your database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Learn more from the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).

### Postgres on Neon

We use Neon for serverless Postgres hosting. Set up your database URL in the `.env.local` file. Visit the [Neon documentation](https://neon.tech/docs/) for more information.

### NextAuth.js

NextAuth.js handles authentication in our application. Configure providers and callbacks in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts`. See the [NextAuth.js documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction) for details.

### tRPC

tRPC enables end-to-end typesafe APIs. Define your procedures in `server/routers` and use them in your frontend with full type safety. Check out the [tRPC documentation](https://trpc.io/docs) to learn more.

### Zod

We use Zod for schema validation throughout the application. Define your schemas in `lib/validations`. See the [Zod documentation](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for usage details.

## Testing

We use Jest and React Testing Library for testing. Run tests with:

```
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

Write your tests in the `tests` directory, following the `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` naming convention.

## Code Quality

We use ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. Run linting with:

```
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

Format your code with:

```
npm run format
# or
yarn format
```

## Deployment

NeonStack is designed to be easily deployed to platforms like Vercel or Netlify. Follow their respective documentation for deploying Next.js applications.

Remember to set up your environment variables in your deployment platform, including your Neon database URL and any API keys.
